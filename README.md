# BigCommerce Add-Ons App

This repository contains the Node.js Express backend and storefront widget for the BigCommerce Add-Ons feature. The backend exposes endpoints to manage add-on mappings and automatically fetch add-on products based on a category. The public widget script injects an “Add Something Extra” section on the product page and bundles selected add-ons into the cart via the Storefront API.

Refer to the internal documentation or comments in `index.js` and `public/add-ons-widget.js` for configuration and deployment details.
